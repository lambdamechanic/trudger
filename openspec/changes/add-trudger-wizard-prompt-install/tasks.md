## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Embed prompt sources in the Rust binary (same content as `prompts/trudge.md` and `prompts/trudge_review.md`).
- [ ] 1.2 Extend `trudger wizard` to offer prompt installation (missing prompts and "update if different" flows).
- [ ] 1.3 Add a "skip prompt install" path that still writes config but prints clear follow-up instructions.
- [ ] 1.4 Add tests for prompt install/update/skip and error handling (permission/IO failures).
- [ ] 1.5 Update `README.md` / docs to reflect wizard-managed prompt install and retain `./install.sh` as an alternative.
